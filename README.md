# LangChain RAG Platform

This repository hosts a multi-stage implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform built with LangChain v1.0, FastAPI, and a modern React front end. Milvus serves as the managed vector database. Each development stage is documented under `docs/`, allowing iterative delivery and knowledge sharing.

## Repository Layout

- `backend/` – FastAPI service orchestrating ingestion, preprocessing, and retrieval workflows with LangChain.
- `frontend/` – React + Vite application for uploads, document management, and the conversational UI.
- `docs/` – Stage-by-stage documentation describing goals, deliverables, and lessons learned.

Refer to the stage documentation for detailed instructions on running and extending each component.
